# Notes

1. Let's try to make it as generic as possible. So it would be the client responsibility to display it correctly.
   1. We should go into attributes / options approach instead of defining size and color on product itself
   2. Each variant should have a price and SKU
   3. Variants should be connected by some parent (for example T-Shirt has one name and description but multiple sizes
      and colors)
   4. Some variants could be out of stock or more expensive
2. Description should be markdown
   1. And support custom components (for example for creating drop-downs)
3. General Idea:
   1. Headless approach
   2. Tenant support
   3. 1st app - API for shop, so you can create your own shops - GraphQL using yoga
   4. 2nd app - actual store implementation using NextJS
   5. 3rd app - Admin panel for managing products, orders, customers, etc. - some web app with REST. Admin panel with xhtml.
   6. 4th app - Landing page - Astro ???
   7. AI Support - generating images and descriptions for products etc.

# Technical:

- [x] Reusable PriceMapper
- [x] Handle nulls better in Product price (do not allow `!` in general)
- [x] Move db schema closer to the modules
- [x] Introduce HashID as a resolver for ID scalar
- [x] Github
- [ ] Fly.io
  - [ ] Database setup - Neon
  - [ ] Add migration task
- [ ] Handle errors generically (for example do not throw "Not found" string)
- [ ] Add linter for graphql and TS
- [ ] Run prettier and linter on generated by codegen files
- [ ] Data Loader for batching queries or something
- [ ] Consider price as graphql-scalar
- [ ] Consider using effect TS
- [ ] MonoRepo

# API

Products:

- queries
  - [x] query by slug
  - [ ] paginated list of products
  - [ ] product details programmed (assets, images, variants)
  - [ ] similar products
  - [ ] product variants
  - [ ] upsell other - bought together
  - [ ] proper pagination
- Ideas:
  - [ ] MultiLanguage
- Tooling:
  - [ ] Dependabot / RenovateBot
  - [ ] Some AI powered code reviews for Github
  - [ ] Code audits
