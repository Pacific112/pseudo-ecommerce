1. Let's try to make it as generic as possible. So it would be the client responsibility to display it correctly.
   1. We should go into attributes / options approach instead of defining size and color on product itself
   2. Each variant should have a price and SKU
   3. Variants should be connected by some parent (for example T-Shirt has one name and description but multiple sizes
      and colors)
   4. Some variants could be out of stock or more expensive
2. Description should be markdown
   1. And support custom components (for example for creating drop-downs)

Technical:

- [] Reusable PriceMapper
- [] Handle nulls better in Product price (do not allow `!` in general) - this one should be a scalar
- [] Move db schema closer to the modules
- [] Handle errors generically (for example do not throw "Not found" string)
- [] Add linter for graphql and TS
- [] Run prettier and linter on generated by codegen files
- [] Introduce HashID as a resolver for ID scalar

Projects:

- queries
  - [ ] query by slug
  - [ ] paginated list of products
  - [ ] product details
  - [ ] similar products
  - [ ] (for later) product variants
  - [ ] (for later) upsell other - bought together
