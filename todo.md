1. Let's try to make it as generic as possible. So it would be the client responsibility to display it correctly.
   1. We should go into attributes / options approach instead of defining size and color on product itself
   2. Each variant should have a price and SKU
   3. Variants should be connected by some parent (for example T-Shirt has one name and description but multiple sizes and colors)
   4. Some variants could be out of stock or more expensive
